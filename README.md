## Abstract

Functional annotation is a critical step in understanding the biological roles of genes and proteins in complex systems. The abundance of genomic and proteomic data facilities feasibility and need for tools that can annotate large datasets. This project aims to streamline the process of gene and protein annotation. We will attempt to integrate multiple bioinformatics resources, including sequence similarity searches, domain identification, and pathway mapping, to provide comprehensive functional annotations.

We begin with the identification of homologous sequences using established databases and tools. We then predict functional domains and motifs by querying domain-specific repositories such as Pfam and InterPro. Finally, we use pathway mapping to link genes and proteins to known biological processes using resources like KEGG. The steps would be designed with modularity in mind, which will allow customization and expansion, enabling it to adapt to specific research needs and datasets.

This approach would reduce the time and effort required for functional annotation, making it accessible for large-scale studies. The diversity of data sources ensure accurate and detailed functional predictions, supporting downstream analyses in genomics, proteomics, and systems biology.
